    "summary": "**Orchestra Structure and Roles**  \n- **Section Leadership**: Each instrument section has a leader (e.g., head cello, head of violas, concertmaster).  \n- **Responsibilities**: Members watch their section leader, conductor, and music for cues like bow direction and tempo.  \n- **Conductor\u2019s Role**: Maestro Cortesi acts as a \"track cop,\" relaying musical ideas through intermediaries rather than controlling every detail.  \n\n**Instrumentation and Historical Context**  \n- **String Section**: Includes violins, violas, cellos, and double basses.  \n- **Woodwinds**: Flutes, oboes, clarinets, and bassoons.  \n- **Brass**: Four horns, two trumpets, and kettle drums.  \n- **Historical Instruments**:  \n  - **Horns**: Natural horns (no valves) used in Beethoven\u2019s time, requiring crooks (tubing adjustments) to change keys. Modern horns use valves instead.  \n  - **Trumpets**: Natural instruments limited to overtone series notes; used primarily for rhythm, not melody.  \n\n**Beethoven\u2019s Use of Brass Instruments**  \n- **Horns**: Play the main theme in the first movement; switch keys using crooks (historically) or valves (modern).  \n- **Trumpets**: Function as rhythm instruments, complementing kettle drums. Unlike later periods, they do not play melodic lines in Beethoven\u2019s works.  \n- **Modern Interpretations**: Some conductors alter Beethoven\u2019s trumpet parts to use modern valve trumpets for melody, but Maestro Cortesi preserves the original intent, emphasizing rhythm and emphasis as Beethoven intended.  \n\n**Performance Context**  \n- The orchestra\u2019s sound combines strings, woodwinds, and brass, with distinct roles for each section.  \n- Beethoven\u2019s instrumentation reflects historical practices, prioritizing rhythmic and textural effects over modern flexibility.",

    "transcription": " There's a kind of teamwork involved, and there's relay work, and there's rehearsal, and there's getting everything right, and there's reading the music, but various people lead various sections of the orchestra, so there's a head cello. Juyeon here is the head of all these cello people. Fred back there is the head in the way of the double bassist. George is the head of the violas, Emma is the head of the second violins, and Sumire here is the head of the first violins, and therefore the head of the orchestra, the concertmaster. She's playing the role of Ignaz Schupanzig in tonight's concert. So your job as a member of the orchestra is to be together with the other people in your section, and what you do is you have to watch the music, you have to be with your stand partner, you watch the person who is the head of your section for things like when the bow changes direction, how fast the bow goes, and all those kinds of things so that we can be together. At the same time you keep an eye on the conductor, and on your section leader, and on the concertmaster, and on the music. So there's an awful lot to be doing, and Maestro Cortesi, as good as he is, is not in charge of everything. He's just a kind of track cop, and a person whose ideas for the music get transmitted to all these people through intermediaries. So string players, woodwinds, you can see the woodwinds back there, flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and then as far away as possible the brass instruments. There are Beethoven calls for four horns, there are four horns and two trumpets, and a pair of kettle drums that always play along with the trumpets. In Beethoven's day, as you may know, the horns were all natural horns. They were just a length of tubing with a funnel on one end and a mouthpiece on the other end, and you had to make all of your notes using the notes of the overtone series, and with a horn you can use your hand and the bell to change, to bend some of the pitches and get some extra notes. They also had crooks that you could take out and make a different crook in the horn, so you could have a different length of horn. So Beethoven expecting natural horns calls for horns in two different keys in this movement, and the horns change key between movements and sometimes within movements, by taking out one crook and putting in another crook. These people don't do that. They have these wonderful modern horns where instead of having crooks, you have a valve that adds a length of tubing, so it turns into a horn of a different length. The trumpets don't have that. I mean, the trumpets in Beethoven's time were also natural instruments, sort of eight feet long with a mouthpiece here and a bell down there, curled up a little bit so that you can hold it and it's not nobody trips over it. But you can't shove your hand in the bell, and so the trumpets play just the notes that trumpets can play. Anyhow, let's listen to the different sections of the orchestra. Here's the main theme of this first movement. Here's that part where everybody plays, this is what happens when only the strings play. And that same passage, here's what the woodwind instruments play at the same time. And then here's what the brass instruments play, the horns and trumpets. You'll probably notice that the horns are playing the tune and the trumpets are not. Trumpets in Beethoven and also in Mozart and Haydn and all through this period are essentially rhythm instruments. They go along with the kettle drums and it makes a wonderful effect. They play only the notes of the overtone series. Somehow, the wonderful techniques of earlier times like the trumpets in Handel's Messiah are not used in this period, and trumpets actually have a much easier job in Beethoven than they do in Handel and Bach. Some composers and conductors have had the temerity to change Beethoven's trumpet parts, because they say nowadays with our modern valve trumpets, the trumpets can play anything we want to, so let's have them play the tune too. I'm glad Maestro Cortesi is not doing that because Beethoven knows exactly what he's doing. He writes for the trumpets things that give punch and emphasis and rhythm to the sound of the orchestra, and I'm very glad we're leaving them just the way Beethoven wrote them, even though we could, these trumpeters could play anything in the world you want nowadays. Anyhow, put that together, the strings, the woodwinds and the brass all together, and this is the sound they make. Thank you.",
